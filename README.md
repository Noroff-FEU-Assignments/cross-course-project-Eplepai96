Ecommerce website selling jackets at affordable prices.


## Description
Ecommerce website selling mid range jackets for varying weather. Initially buildt with HTML and CSS only, but added WordPress REST API during our CMS course. Currently not functional, as I forgot to change the local links to the public ones. I'll update this when I do the resit at Noroff.
